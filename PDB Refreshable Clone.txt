Source DB: 
- login to cdb and create a user
CREATE USER c##refresh IDENTIFIED BY WElcome_12# CONTAINER=ALL; 
GRANT CREATE SESSION, CREATE PLUGGABLE DATABASE TO c##refresh CONTAINER=ALL;

if this is for DR purposes, create the same user in the TARGET too
CREATE USER c##refresh IDENTIFIED BY WElcome_12# CONTAINER=ALL; 
GRANT CREATE SESSION, CREATE PLUGGABLE DATABASE TO c##refresh CONTAINER=ALL;

Destination DB:
- Make sure local_undo_enables is set to true
Local UNDO is necessary to ensure the source remains in read-write during the cloning process.
SELECT property_name, property_value FROM database_properties WHERE property_name = 'LOCAL_UNDO_ENABLED';


SSH to the target database
edit the tnsnames.ora to add the source cdb connection string
- Add the source cdb to the tnsnames.ora in the target database

SOURCEDB =
  (DESCRIPTION=(CONNECT_TIMEOUT=5)(TRANSPORT_CONNECT_TIMEOUT=3)(RETRY_COUNT=3)(ADDRESS_LIST=(LOAD_BALANCE=on)(ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=TCP)(HOST=hostip)(PORT=1521)))(CONNECT_DATA=(SERVICE_NAME=servicename)))
  
- Create dblink to the source dba on the target db
create public database link refresh_pdb connect to c##refresh identified by WElcome_12# using 'SOURCEDB';

- Check if the dblink is working on the target db
alter session set global_names=false; 
select * from dual@refresh_pdb;

Refresh modes
